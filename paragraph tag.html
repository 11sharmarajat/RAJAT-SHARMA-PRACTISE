<h1>HTML</h1>
<p>HTML A tags, also known as anchor tags, are often overlooked for more traditional internal linking methods.

                When incorporated into the code of a webpage, anchor tags and their attributes function as specialized hyperlinks that allow users to “jump” from one section of a webpage to another. 
                
                These hyperlinks are highly SEO- and user-friendly because they help educate search engines on the overall topic of a webpage, help keep code neat and organized in the backend, and enhance the user’s experience, because users do not need to scroll through slabs of text.

<h1>CSS:</h1>
<div>Otherwise known as an HTML A tag (or interchangeably as the “anchor element”), the anchor tag introduces an internal hyperlink on a webpage. 

            Specifically, anchor tags allow users to “jump” from one section of a webpage to another section on the same page. You can attach the anchor tag to any specific heading, keyword, or phrase (thereby creating what is known as an “anchor element”). 
            
            For example, you can use anchor text to direct users from a “Table of Contents” section to a particular area of the webpage without the need for excessive scrolling <span>hello rajat sharmaaaaaaaaaaa</span>
