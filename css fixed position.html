        <div id="d1">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]

            CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
            
            Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]
            
            The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.
            
            The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.[5]
            
            In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL.
            
            Syntax
            CSS has a simple syntax and uses a number of English keywords to specify the names of various style properties.
            
            A style sheet consists of a list of rules. Each rule or rule-set consists of one or more selectors, and a declaration block.
            
            Selector
            "CSS class" redirects here. For non-CSS use of element classes in HTML, see class attribute (HTML).
            In CSS, selectors declare which part of the markup a style applies to by matching tags and attributes in the markup itself.
            
            Selectors may apply to the following:
            
            all elements of a specific type, e.g. the second-level headers h2
            elements specified by attribute, in particular:
            id: an identifier unique within the document, denoted in the selector language by a hash prefix e.g. #id
            class: an identifier that can annotate multiple elements in a document, denoted by a dot prefix e.g. .classname (the phrase "CSS class", although sometimes used, is a misnomer, as element classes—specified with the HTML class attribute—is a markup feature that is distinct from browsers' CSS subsystem and the related W3C/WHATWG standards work on document styles; see RDF and microformats for the origins of the "class" system of the Web content model)
            elements depending on how they are placed relative to others in the document tree.</div>
